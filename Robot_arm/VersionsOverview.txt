Robot Arm project 
Version History

---
Model v1.0
implemented for assigment 1

First simple system boundary definition model.
Variables kept in sequences for easy priting.

---
Model v1.1
implemented for assigment 2

Separated phisical system and environment.
Itroduced PD-controller for step function.
New scenarios, to fit to the new controller

---
Model v1.2
implemented for assigment 3

Further Separated controller and environment into different files.
Make controller regulate the tourque set on the motor of the robot arm.
---
Model v1.3
Implementd for assignment 4

Made the model concurrent, and shifted away from a user-centric perspective to a controller-centric perspective.
Implemented real time durations for the various operations
---
Model v2.0

Decomposing architecture for clean interface. Introduced running
the simulation on threads with periodic loop functions, for each
of the components

---
Model v2.1

Introduced controller modes in the system to handle environmen-
tal events such as motor malfunction or physical blockage of the
arm. Test scenarios for the environmental events were created.

---
Model v2.2

Implemented gravity and friction
