# Robotic Arm Controller
# Overview

In manufacturing and other industries, robotic arms are essential for various tasks such as manipulation, picking up, moving around, and placing objects. This project focuses on the control of a robotic arm, which comprises a series of links connected by joints, with an end effector (the "hand") at the end of the arm. Each joint is equipped with an electric actuator (a motor) to change the angle of the joint, allowing precise movement and positioning of the end effector.

This repository contains software for controlling a robotic arm with a single degree of freedom. The arm's movement is controlled within a safe range of angles from 0 radians to Ï€/4 radians. The arm can be either stationary or in motion, and factors such as gravity and friction torque influence its behavior.
# Key Features

    Control of a robotic arm with a single degree of freedom.
    Safe angle range for joint movement.
    Consideration of gravity and friction torque.
    Constant parameters such as end effector mass, gravity, and link length.

# Installation

To install and run the Robotic Arm Controller, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (list them if necessary).
    Compile or run the software according to the provided instructions.

# Usage

After installation, you can use the Robotic Arm Controller in your projects as follows:

    Initialize the robotic arm with the provided constants (end effector mass, gravity, etc.).
    Use the provided functions to control the arm's movement and perform desired tasks.
    Ensure to stay within the safe range of joint angles to prevent damage or instability.

# Constants

The following constants are used in the robotic arm model:

    End Effector Mass: The mass of the robotic hand.
    Gravity: Acceleration due to gravity.
    Link Length: Length of the arm's links.

These constants remain constant during operation under the assumptions of the environment.
